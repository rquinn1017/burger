# Quinn Burger

Quinn Burger is an application where a hungery person can order a custom burger to be placed on the Quinn Burger menu. After ordering the burger, the burger will be placed on the menu from which said hungry person can devour the burger. SInce this resturaunt uses only the freshes ingredients, once a menu item has been eaten it is off the menu never to be devoured again, unless of course you order another one. 

The application uses express, mySQL, dotenv, handlebars, and is deployed on heroku using JawsDB.
